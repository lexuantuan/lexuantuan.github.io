## Thesis
- Understanding complex systems through computational modeling and simulation

### Abstract
- Complexity of complex systems comes from the relations/interactions of a large number of diverse, interacting parts that lead to emergent behaviors which are often counterintuitive, not expected or predictable based on knowledge of the parts of the systems. Traditional approaches such as statistical or experimental ones are not sufficient, and sometimes impossible in dealing with complexity issues such as emergence, self-organization, evolution and adaptation of complex systems. Computational modeling and simulation transforms these observed complex phenomena into conceptual models which are formulated into algorithms that can be executed to yield predictions and estimate hidden parameters. The idea is, we can construct models from bottom-up, without knowing beforehand its macroscopic behaviors. By specifying the behaviors of each individual (using statecharts, for example) and its interactions with other individuals and the environment, and then set the model to an initial configuration and watch it evolve over time in silico, we could make the predictions about future state of the system based on the microscopic state of the real system. These predictions can later be compared to the observations, revealing to what extent the model is an accurate description of the real system, thus generates an additional understanding of the phenomena. In this way, computational models such as cellular automata or agent based models could be complementary to the traditional ones, and in some cases, they are unique solutions due to legal, ethical issues. Statechart can address the problem of "translating" text- based description information into computable model since statechart can be executable code with the support of simulation software platform such as AnyLogic. From the computational viewpoint, the translation of domain information into computable models highlight the importance of statechart in modeling. In addition to the use of statchart, the thesis also propose to incoporate machine learning technique such as decision tree to help agent's decision making. The adaptation aspect of the agents is thus modeled in a very legible form.
